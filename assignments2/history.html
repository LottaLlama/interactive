        Back in the days of Movinin, the first dust bunnies arose out of the carpet in their magnificent splendor. These were the motes. They struggled for a few months to take their footing and to found a new civilization. The tribal residents at the time from other nearby regions — Closetfloor, Inthecouch, Underthefridge, and the former Bathroomgrime — already had a leg up on the motes in terms of their dustiness. The motes had a difficult time fending off their territory from which they had sprung.
        <br><br>
        Then came the first fruit, a small blue. The motes had no idea what this object was and pushed it to the edge of their territory. However, over a series of days the small blue was imparted with the wisdom of the Mold. As the Mold began to cover the small blue, the motes realized that the Mold was forming in their own image. The Mold had chosen them to be governors of this land, and with this strengthened resolve the motes began to fight back. This increased sense of nationalism brought the motes to victory as they secured the borders of their territory. As is dust bunny fashion, they named their land Underthebed and declared their people the powdery.
        <br><br>
        The kingdom began to expand with the new addition of houses and impressive cardboard castles. The powdery became the elite population as new forms of dust bunnies began to propagate in small communities along the outskirts of the land. Royal gardens complete with noble spider enclosures and penny reflecting pools were equally as prevalent as the spiritual dusters who interpreted new readings the Mold might offer to help the land prosper.
        <br><br>
        However, there became political disputes between the royal powderies and the spiritual dusters, namely that the powderies felt the spiritual dusters were undermining their authority. Thus the spiritual dusters were inconspicuously relocated to the Old Sock, far enough away from the main castle to significantly minimize their political power. The lay dust bunny population, now consisting of poofs and clodded, still followed the words of the spiritual dusters in their own homes.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, ignoring the word of the Mold would prove an unfortunate situation for the powderies in due time. The Mold portrayed a deadly catastrophe, a whirlwind that would ravage the land brought about by the Overs. Although the spiritual dusters diligently tried to warn the powderies of the imminent situation at hand, the royal family brushed off this warning in their arrogance. The Overs were of no concern to them, they believed, and if any harm were to come to the dust bunnies, they would be able to protect Underthebed, just as their ancestors had in the previous era.
        <br><br>
        Whether or not bunnies listened to the words of the spiritual dusters, the Purge came. Several grueling minutes of an intense whirlwind pulled dust bunnies from the carpet and shook up the landscape, toppling houses, disrupting gardens and farms, and knocking a large portion of the main powdery castle to the floor. Those who heeded the spiritual duster’s advice were appropriately prepared and did not lose much in the Purge. This time marked the end of the golden age of the powderies, as the kingdom grew discontent with the apparent lack of concern the royal family had toward their people.
        <br><br>
        Many of the poofs were avid disciples of the Mold and thought that the spiritual dusters should be handed back their authority. One poof in particular, Saran Floof, decided to rally up his fellow Mold followers in disdaining the powdery authority. As Floof’s followers increased, the nervous powderies took notice and began to enforce stricter control over dust bunny gatherings throughout the land. However, Floof was determined to reinstate the spiritual dusters and continued his rallies in the underground theme. Eventually these rallies included the newly formed close cousin of the poofs, the stringies, and the cloddeds. Floof’s right-hand dust, Laurence McStrung, was able to gathered rag scrap arms in a first attempt at an active rebellion, a coup d’état. But instead of an attempt, the poofs and stringies liked this idea of rebellion so much that they decided to lead an all-or-nothing attack against the powderies. The cloddeds were in support of reinstating the spiritual dusters, but advocated for non-violence. But the rebellion had grown too strong and with McStrung at the head of the rebellion and Floof rallying the troops, a violent coup seemed inevitable.
        <br><br>
        Although the powderies had sensed unrest within the dust bunny population, they were completely blindsided by the organization and force with which the rebellion had attacked; the royal family was duly unprepared for this battle, especially as they were in the middle of cardboard repair on their main ramparts. Soon after the rebellion began, in an effort to instill fear in their opponents, the powderies made an announcement that all should be unsettled by their inherent prowess in battle as their mote ancestors had proven before. This proclamation did not but anger the rebellious dust bunnies further, particularly McStrung who felt disrespected at how his troops were perceived as formly inferior. Nonetheless Floof and McStrung were able to successfully order their troops to defeat the powderies who, as part of the treaty agreement, were forced into exile until midway through the current era.
        <br><br>
        A new republic had now been instated as the Republic of Underthebed. Unfortunately this treaty agreement caused some tension between Floof and McStrung. Whereas Floof was content with sending the powderies into exile as the rebellion had successfully reinstated the spiritual dusters as advisors to the republic, McStrung thought greater reparations should be in effect by the royal family for all the damaged caused by their arrogance concerning the Purge. Furthermore, he thought the heads of the royal family should be dedusted. The powderies in their fear of being dedusted, suggested a small compensation to be paid to the poofs in return for Floof’s suggestion for exile. Floof and his other poof followers accepted this treaty offer which in turn alienated McStrung and the stringies. McStrung was furious with this agreement, but soon after fell violently ill and was swept away.
        <br><br>
        Thus the poofs ushered in a new reign of the Republic of Underthebed where the community flourished in the arts, culture, science, and technology as it continues to do so today. Floof when on to become the president of the republic and avidly devoted much of his time to aid the spiritual dusters in promoting the word of the Mold. We dust bunnies pass down this important history to younger generations so that we all might remember from where we came.
