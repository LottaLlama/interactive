      <p margin-top="20px">Travel out to the western edge of Underthebed to discover our newest sticky addition. This is an unusual substance which we have coined it “The Gum” due to its wonderful adhesive properties. When a band of stringies encountered this phenomenon, one left part of his ear in this pink substance and it took nearly a week for experts to get it back out!
      <br><br>
      However, no threat has been detected from The Gum, and much of its dust-removing properties have been neutralized. However, enough of its natural adhesive has been preserved so that fellow dust bunnies might leave a small dustprint to immortalize their visit. You might even see dustprints of Jacques DePoof and Honey Powders! If you cannot see The Gum on your visit to Underthebed, you can alway see it later as this attraction won’t be going anywhere for a while.
